[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/glhmm/badge/?version=latest)](https://glhmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

The GLHMM toolbox provides facilities to fit a variety of Hidden Markov models (HMM) based on the Gaussian distribution, which we generalise as the Gaussian-Linear HMM. 
Crucially, the toolbox has a focus on finding associations at various levels between brain data (EEG, MEG, fMRI, ECoG, etc) and non-brain data, such as behavioural or physiological variables.

```bash
pip install glhmm
```

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)
In addition to using the GLHMM toolbox as a Python package, a graphical user interface (GUI) is now available. The GUI offers an intuitive, code-free way to load data, train models, run statistical tests, and visualise results.

#### Access the GUI
To access the GUI, visit the companion repository: 
**[https://github.com/Nick7900/glhmm_protocols](https://github.com/Nick7900/glhmm_protocols)**

The GUI is built using Streamlit and can be launched locally. Instructions for setup and use are provided in that repository.

#### Video Tutorial
An introductory walkthrough of the GUI is available here:
